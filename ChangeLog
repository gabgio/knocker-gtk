- $Id: ChangeLog file for gtk-knocker version 0.6.6 - released on 31 March 2002
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31 March 2002
  - gtk-knocker rwritten from scratch.
  - GUI interface redesigned using GLADE.
  - "Freeze" bug fixed. The GUI interface is no longer freezing during long
    scans.
  - Start / Stop scan buttons are now working properly.
  - Logging the scan results to file is now possible.
  - Application icon added. (If the WM supports it).
  - Changed the gtk-knocker logo pic in the about window, again.

1 August 2001
  - Splitted the gtk-knocker.c windows source code in modules:
    main_win.c, about_win.c
  - The scan loop is now called by the gtk_timeout_add(...)
    function. This however does not fix the "freeze bug".
  - Added gtk-knocker header file (gtk-knocker.h).
  - Added a splash_screen dialog box (dialogs.c)
  - Added an error dialog box that is shown if a hostname cannot
    be resolved (dialogs.c).(Scan is now aborted in this version).
  - Added a "stop the scan" button. Thought this feature is not
    yet implemented.
  - Changed the gtk-knocker logo pic in the about window.

15 July 2001
  - Added a function in knocker_core.c to resolve hosts IP.
  - Added the host IP address field to the interface.

08 July 2001:
  - Initial release.
